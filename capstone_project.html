            <p>
              Our Capstone team developed a modular, high-throughput automated sorting system tailored for JA Orchards LTD,an orchard in urgent need of a replacement solution following the closure of their regional sorting facility. The goal was to sort apples at a rate of 100 apples per minute using pre-assigned grades from an external vision classifier. Our system ensures precise, impact-mitigated routing of apples into designated bins through electromechanical tilting trays and damped collection paths.
              <br><br>
              The final design includes a custom elliptical guide rail conveyor system with 100 modular carriages. These carriages are fitted with food-safe high-density polyethylene trays mounted using PTFE sleeve bearings,ideal for dirty and humid orchard environments. A solenoid-activated over-center mechanism allows each tray to tilt precisely once it reaches its designated station, gently diverting the apple into a bin.
              <br><br>
              Once tilted, apples land on a silicone impact-damping tray designed to distribute kinetic energy through curvature and friction, reducing bruising. These trays also integrate a gate mechanism to prevent drops during downtime or bin swaps. Storage crates,standard 48" x 48" x 28",are mounted on hydraulically actuated frames that gradually lower as they fill, maintaining a gentle receiving angle for each apple.
              <br><br>
              The images below showcase the physical configuration of the system:

            The goal of our project was to design a system, to accomplish this goal we needed to be systemic. 
            From the moment we were given our project description, we set out to clearly establish three important factors; user-requirements (scope), 
            deliverable time-line (milestones), and team strengths (proficiencies). Through meetings with our client, faculty advisors, and capstone instructors,
            we were able to formally outline what requirements our design was required to meet, what each step of the project entailed, and when are we expected to report on our progress.
            <br><br>
            To gain real-world experience in project managament and leadership, I nominated myself to be project-lead and the group unanimously agreed.
            Having been paired up with a fairly random group of students from different specializations with unique proficiencies, I 
            focused the first few weeks on getting to know each memeber of my group so that I could better delegate the workload. I accomplished this during 
            our team meetings where I drafted up a document highlighting my work experiece, specialization, and areas of interest and asked everyone to add an entry of their own. 
            <br><br>
            The first milestone of the project was the conceptual design report were we were tasked with fleshing out details of our projects like shareholders, technical and functional 
            requirements, and risk. Through two well-planned meetings with our client we were able to complete this report effectively. Our first meeting we introduced ourselves, highlighling 
            each memebers proficiencies to the client and inquringing about his expectations and requirements regarding the project. The second client meeting focused on validating our understanding
            of the project's requirements and finalizing its scope.
