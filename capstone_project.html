        <p class="section-subheading capstone-section-subheading">
            As project lead, I guided our capstone team to design a compact apple-sorting system that processes 100 apples per
            minute. The main objective was to help a local orchard avoid outsourcing to large-scale facilities while preserving
            fruit quality and meeting food-safety standards.
            <br><br>
            We started by confirming performance goalsâ€”high throughput, gentle handling to prevent bruising, and seamless
            integration into existing workflows. From there, we explored multiple conveyor-based concepts: some relied on tilt-tray
            mechanisms, others employed gated diverts. By holding iterative design reviews and consulting with orchard staff, we
            narrowed these ideas down into a single cohesive layout that combined reliable sorting with straightforward maintenance.
            <br><br>
            Our final deliverable is a comprehensive 3D CAD model that illustrates each subassembly, from the intake conveyor to the
            diverter stations and bin placements. In these drawings, we address real-world factors like ease of maintenance, risk of
            bruising, and spatial constraints. Each design element balances efficiency, safety, and durability, resulting in a
            well-documented blueprint that the orchard can use to fabricate and deploy its own in-house sorting solution.

        <p class="section-subheading capstone-section-subheading">
            The goal of our project was to design a system, to accomplish this goal we needed to be systemic. 
            From the moment we were given our project description, we set out to clearly establish three important factors; user-requirements (scope), 
            deliverable time-line (milestones), and team strengths (proficiencies). Through meetings with our client, faculty advisors, and capstone instructors,
            we were able to formally outline what requirements our design was required to meet, what each step of the project entailed, and when are we expected to report on our progress.
            <br><br>
            To gain real-world experience in project managament and leadership, I nominated myself to be project-lead and the group unanimously agreed.
            Having been paired up with a fairly random group of students from different specializations with unique proficiencies, I 
            focused the first few weeks on getting to know each memeber of my group so that I could better delegate the workload. I accomplished this during 
            our team meetings where I drafted up a document highlighting my work experiece, specialization, and areas of interest and asked everyone to add an entry of their own. 
            <br><br>
            The first milestone of the project was the conceptual design report were we were tasked with fleshing out details of our projects like shareholders, technical and functional 
            requirements, and risk. Through two well-planned meetings with our client we were able to complete this report effectively. Our first meeting we introduced ourselves, highlighling 
            each memebers proficiencies to the client and inquringing about his expectations and requirements regarding the project. The second client meeting focused on validating our understanding
            of the project's requirements and finalizing its scope.
