        Serving as project lead during this capstone was a defining experience in my growth as an engineer. Beyond the technical complexity of designing a high-throughput apple-sorting system, I learned how much leadership relies on clarity, coordination, and keeping a team aligned when things donâ€™t go according to plan.
        <br><br>
        One of the most important lessons I took away was the value of iteration, not only in the design process but also in how we functioned as a team. Setting the direction meant more than proposing solutions. It involved listening carefully, balancing competing ideas, and knowing when to pivot. Our design encountered real obstacles, from component failures to shifting timelines, and I came to understand that steady leadership often means maintaining focus and calm when uncertainty sets in.
        <br><br>
        This experience also reshaped how I view the role of the engineer. Technical ability is essential, but it must be paired with a strong sense of responsibility to the people and systems we serve. I felt this most clearly in discussions around usability and safety, where design trade-offs had real consequences for the end users of our system.
        <br><br>
        Throughout the project, I saw how I naturally gravitate toward organizing complexity and making decisive calls under pressure. At the same time, I recognized the need to develop more patience, especially during the early stages of problem-solving when ideas are still taking shape. Going forward, I plan to give more space for ambiguity and resist the urge to jump to quick conclusions. This experience challenged my thinking, strengthened my confidence, and gave me a clearer sense of how I want to approach my work as both an engineer and a leader.

            As project lead, I guided our capstone team to design a compact apple-sorting system that processes 100 apples per
            minute. The main objective was to help a local orchard avoid outsourcing to large-scale facilities while preserving
            fruit quality and meeting food-safety standards.
            <br><br>
            We started by confirming performance goals,high throughput, gentle handling to prevent bruising, and seamless
            integration into existing workflows. From there, we explored multiple conveyor-based concepts: some relied on tilt-tray
            mechanisms, others employed gated diverts. By holding iterative design reviews and consulting with orchard staff, we
            narrowed these ideas down into a single cohesive layout that combined reliable sorting with straightforward maintenance.
            <br><br>
            Our final deliverable is a comprehensive 3D CAD model that illustrates each subassembly, from the intake conveyor to the
            diverter stations and bin placements. In these drawings, we address real-world factors like wash-down cleaning, risk of
            bruising, and spatial constraints. Each design element balances efficiency, safety, and durability, resulting in a
            well-documented blueprint that the orchard can use to fabricate and deploy its own in-house sorting solution.
